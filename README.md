 What is rsyslog?
rsyslog is a system that collects and manages log messages from different parts of your computer. Think of it as a logbook where your system writes down everything that happens, such as login attempts, errors, warnings, and system updates.


What is journalctl?
journalctl is a modern logging tool that works with systemd, the process manager of Linux. Unlike rsyslog, which stores logs in plain text files, journalctl keeps logs in a binary format, making it more efficient and powerful.

ðŸ”¹ Example of journalctl in action:
If you try and fail to log in, journalctl can help you find out why.
If your system is running slow, journalctl can show recent errors and warnings.
